; --- This draws the last third, that is an uncomplete one, to do so, the file will come prepared so instead of an standar third with 8 character rows, it's a rare third with less rows.
;     For easier undesrtanding we will call 'row" each character row left, and 'line' each pixel line left, so each row is built by 8 lines.
;     Usually, you can read all first pixel lines for each rows in a third by reading 256 bytes (32 * 8), but if instead of 8 rows we have less, then we have to read 32 * <number of rows>
;     To determine how many rows are left we divide lines left by 8, but then to calculate how many bytes we have to read to load first pixel line for those rows we multiply by 32,
;     so in the end we multiply by 4. Once we know how much to read per each iteration we have to do 8 iterations, one per each line in a character. So we first prepare <lines left>*4 in
;     BC register,and then just read BC bytes 8 times, increasin IX (pointing to VRAM) by 256 each time to point to the next line inside the row
