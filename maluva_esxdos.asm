;     For easier undesrtanding we will call 'row" each character row left, and 'line' each pixel line left, so each row is built by 8 lines.
;     Usually, you can read all first pixel lines for each rows in a third by reading 256 bytes (32 * 8), but if instead of 8 rows we have less, then we have to read 32 * <number of rows>
;     To determine how many rows are left we divide lines left by 8, but then to calculate how many bytes we have to read to load first pixel line for those rows we multiply by 32,
;     so in the end we multiply by 4. Once we know how much to read per each iteration we have to do 8 iterations, one per each line in a character. So we first prepare <lines left>*4 in

; OK, this below needs to be explained: I didn't find a way to call the DAAD function to print text and make it work with an xmessage already loaded in RAM. Everything
					; worked but the \n or  #n carriage return. The function was at address $1629 in the spanish interpreter. Then I decided to do the following: try to make the text
					; being printed by the MES condact, and to do that I as going to execute a MES condact. How do I do that?
					; 1) I modified first entry in the messages offsets table, preserving the value there before, to the address where the xmessage is loaded in RAM
					; 2) I was udpating BC and making sure it is returned modified to the stack. DAAD uses BC as it's internal "PC" register, so changing BC actually makes DAAD run 
					;    opcodes somewhere else. I pointed it to a zone in RAM (see below) where I already had sorted two condacts: MES 0, and EXTERN 0 255. MES 0 prints the text 
					;    using MES condact and then EXTERN 0 255...
					; 3) is another function in Maluva I'm using to restore the Message 0 pointer, and restoring BC, so the execution continues just after the XMES/XMESSAGE call
