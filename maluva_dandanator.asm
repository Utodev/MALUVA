; Notes: 
; Dandanator can page any of its 32 slots over $0000-$3999, and the original ROM if the slot selected is slot 33
; Dandanator can also be locked to avoid unwanted paging. Each game has a slot, the "slot 1", which loads the game, 
; but as there may be more than one game inside a Dandanator, there may be more than one "Slot 1", and not necessarily
; be the real slot #1 of Dandanator. So we will refer to that slot 1 as "myslot". The packager that creates ROM to be
; pushed to Dandanator will patch this extern with the real slot that will be used as Slot 1, that's why there is a
; variable named MySlot in this code in a position that is allways the same.
; Also, this extern will contain the routines that need to be in RAM, but to save space, part of the code that is 
; used only when dandanator "slot 1"  is paged will be located at slot1, to avoid using space in RAM. That's why
; you will see some RST calls down there, they are actually calls to the ROM present at Slot 1, not real Spectrum ROM calls

; --- This draws the last third, that is an uncomplete one, to do so, the file will come prepared so instead of an standar third with 8 character rows, it's a rare third with less rows.
;     For easier undesrtanding we will call 'row" each character row left, and 'line' each pixel line left, so each row is built by 8 lines.
;     Usually, you can read all first pixel lines for each rows in a third by reading 256 bytes (32 * 8), but if instead of 8 rows we have less, then we have to read 32 * <number of rows>
;     To determine how many rows are left we divide lines left by 8, but then to calculate how many bytes we have to read to load first pixel line for those rows we multiply by 32,
;     so in the end we multiply by 4. Once we know how much to read per each iteration we have to do 8 iterations, one per each line in a character. So we first prepare <lines left>*4 in
;     BC register,and then just read BC bytes 8 times, increasin DE (pointing to VRAM) by 256 each time to point to the next line inside the row
